cohere - similar to llama, but on the cloud

	Cohere has some APIs that accomplish exactly
	what we are hoping to achieve:

	 - classify API
		Cohere provides an API in which we can
		create categories, provide examples for them,
		and then find which category a phrase best
		fits into. This would work very well for us.
	 - tokenize API
	 	This tokenizes and embeds different phrases
		relative to one another - it is much more
		powerful but also harder to use, and it isn't
		clear if we need it.

	The classify API could work very well if we sample
	a bunch of random pages at distance 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.
	away from the goal page, and then use this to classify
	whatever next pages we encounter.

	However, API limits could be a concern. We need to watch
	out for this and somehow process in batches.

llama - local and takes up a lot of space

	This takes up WAY too much space, even on
	my PC at home. Cohere works fine enough for
	what we are doing.
